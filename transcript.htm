  <!--Question #1-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q1: what area do you work in,
    do you work in oncology or prenatal?</button>

  <!--Beginning of Transcript-->
  <div class="content">
    <p>A: I do oncology, this is what my lab specifies.
      There are certain labs that just do prenatal so it's
      kind of your pick of the litter kind of thing, and
      then within oncology there's several departments within
      cytogenetics. You can do  karyotyping societal genetics
      or you could do other stuff such as fish among other testing.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #2-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q2: In college, did you just start out wanting to
    be in biology or can you give us a timeline of how
    you went from your high school to where you are now?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: I did biochem the whole way since I was a freshman.
      I kind of just figured like in high school I was good at
      science so it kind of just went that way and I kind of
      stuck with it. I never found a reason to like not do it.
      Of course, that's not saying that I didn't like it, you
      know. There's certain stuff that I did that I enjoyed and
      some stuff that I was okay with, but I never found anything
      that was as appealing to me. I just liked the idea of
      making sense of stuff. So yeah i think it was more just
      like that's what i was good at early on and i just stuck
      with it if that makes sense.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #3-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q3: What is the hardest part like the most or the
    most stressful thing about your job?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: I don't know, there's not too much stress,
      but I would say like messing up. They do come
      down on you pretty hard, but honestly that's
      everywhere, you know. But like you do see it
      though, if you do mess up and for some reason
      it just goes by or like no one catches your
      mistake, that could affect someone's health.
      It's like a big picture, it could have some
      like big consequences. I would say that,
      that’s probably the most stressful part.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #4-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q4: What are the whole processes that you have
    to redo every day as a Cytogenetic Technologist? </button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: It does get repetitive in the way that we
      have a lot like patients every day, right.  My
      specific job would be to pick up a case and
      start reading about the sample, analyze the cells
      and start looking for abnormalities within the
      chromosomes. So we do that and we do sets of ten
      per technologist. So you pick up a case and do
      that, that’s pretty much it. Let's say like keep
      doing it until you find something abnormal. Then
      you also have to go through a way of Karyotyping
      and I guess reporting it and passing it on. It's
      not like it's not like a crazy or a difficult
      thing it's very repetitive, just like cases every
      day. Honestly, it's not too crazy.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #5-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q5: How similar is your current job that you're at,
    to the first job you had coming out of high school
    or college? Is it like uh not like the first job if
    you worked one in early life but the first job in
    this field I should say? </button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: yeah, no, this is my first job. So yeah,
      post college, this is my first job. I don't
      have anything to compare it to.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #6-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q6: My alternate question would be, was there
    a moment where you realized that you had a
    love for the field of biology or is it just
    kind of like you were saying there wasn't anything
    else that really took your interest? </button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: I feel like it's not accurate to say that you
      or someone would love everything about a certain
      field, you know. So I don't think there's always
      gonna be a moment where you find that exact thing,
      but I feel that I like bio or just the concept of
      biology more than anything else. Yeah I wouldn't
      say there's one moment, it might just be the fact
      that's what i was better at, you know. I don't
      think there was like one moment that I was like
      yeah this is this is it, you know.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #7-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q7: Whenever i was researching cytogenetics,
    I saw that there's a wet lab aspect to it. Do
    you just focus on analyzing karyotypes and finding
    abnormalities or do you take part in that side of
    cytogenetics where you are preparing the samples
    and stuff like that?  </button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: Yeah, I mean specifically, I just do the
      analysis of it, just like making the karyotypes
      and stuff, but prior, I had to complete the program
      to get your certification. You have to do uh like
      an internship kind of thing and in that they make
      you do all the wet lab stuff. So like they'll make
      you prepare the cell, the bone marrow, and the
      blood samples or tissue. So while I don't do it
      there, you do have to go through a stage where
      you do it.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #8-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q8: i was wondering if you could give us some
    in-depth information on what technology you use?
    Like how are you analyzing the cells where you're
    working?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: Every lab kind of runs on similar systems of
      analysis. So the bone marrow or the blood gets
      processed. Basically the whole process of the wet
      lab is to individualize the cells because you then
      want to break them open and see their chromosomes.
      Once you get to that part, then there's a machine
      that takes pictures of those of those cells. Those
      pictures get put into a database. The database is
      like the system that we all run on. Then we just
      go in there and start looking at the images. I
      feel like if you're looking for terms of technology,
      you’re probably more like on the wet lab side,
      you know. Like a harvester which is the part of
      the process that individualizes the cells. What
      else, hmm... we use a centrifuge all the time. A
      micropipette, i'm pretty sure that you guys are
      performing with those things now. uh what else
      um in terms of machinery or technology, I that's
      it. For me personally i don't really use much of
      the live equipment because I do the like analysis
      part </p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #9-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q9: What's the difference between you working in
    the lab for your job now compared to when you were
    in school? Is there a big difference between doing
    them in school and working with other students and
    then going into the job and working around people
    in the real field?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: I don't know if it's a big difference, but
      I guess like the whole idea of working in groups
      is like magnified times 10. You really have to work
      to figure out how to work with people, you know?
      Because now it's not like a group project where you
      have to put up with people for like a semester or a
      week or whatever. Now you have to see them every day
      and stuff. So i think that'd be the biggest difference.
      Specifically though, compared to labs that i did at UT,
      I mean i'm saying that if I were to be working on the
      wet lab side of cytogenetics, like the actual processing
      of the patient samples, it'd be like a lot of the same
      stuff. You know like micro pipetting, like measuring
      stuff, you know like a lot of basic stuff that you guys
      would end up doing. So yeah, the biggest difference is
      the fact that you have to work with people that you're
      gonna see for like who knows how long. It's not a
      temporary thing where you can just shrug off a bunch
      of stuff that doesn't sit well with yourself.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #10-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q10: Do you have any internship experience when
    you were in college?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: No, when i was at UT, I did volunteer a lot,
      but like nothing lab related. If it was lab stuff,
      it was because I was doing it for classes. In my
      off time, no. It wasn't until post UT where I was
      doing the certification program at MD Anderson
      where I had to do an internship. After i was done
      with the school part it was just like a summer so
      like, what, 12 weeks? And that's where like you got
      your first experience on how to do stuff and how to
      work around a specific cytogenetic lab. But while
      at UT, no I don't think I did, I don't remember doing
      any internships involving labs.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #11-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q11: I was wondering how much field work goes into
    your job, like maybe collecting samples or working
    with anything like that or is it just all in a lab?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A:  Yeah, it's just all in lab. The samples get mailed
      to us, to the lab. Some hospitals have their own cybergenetic
      department, right, so there you can sometimes get to see the
      process of the patient coming in and all that, extracting the
      bone marrow or blood or whatever. But yeah, since it's a lab,
      we just get a bunch of samples from all over the country.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #12-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q12: okay that's cool that's cool like a story of the
    time that you worked on an interesting case or like an
    interesting situation that you were in?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: um there was just one time about a year ago,
      I guess, at this point now. So the thing with cytogenetics
      and fish is a lot of it's targeted testing. So like the
      physician is going to order the test on the basis that
      he suspects that some type of specific cancer. Most times
      some blood related cancer such as leukemia. So what was
      special about this case is the fact that it was just a
      shot in the dark, like let's see what's going on, who knows.
      No one had an idea what was going on with that patient. But
      I happened to, I found an abnormality that signaled internal
      bleeding, which became an emergency. So at that point you
      just quickly send the results back to the physician so they
      can go back to the patient to try to stop the internal bleeding
      before it gets too late, so that's pretty cool. kind of felt
      cool to like find something that really helped out a person
      you know.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #13-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q13: I was wondering if there was anything affected
     on your side with covid or was everything running
     smoothly?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: Since the whole quarantine started, i've just
      been working from home. I'm able to log into my desktop
      from my personal laptop. I haven't gone, I've gone maybe
      to the lab like once or twice in the past year. There
      are some pros to it but there are some cons to it, like
      you have to read everything, all the communication, which
      there is a good amount of. It has to be done through like
      microsoft teams or something, it's all done through chat.
      It's not ideal but the lab has been making it work.Can't
      complain too much, I mean I still have a job, you know</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #14-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q14:  You said that your job gets repetitive sometimes
    so what is something that you usually look forward to when
    you go in or what is your favorite thing about your
    job?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: I guess maybe because it's repetitive sometimes,
      you feel like you have a good grasp of things, you
      feel like you're good at it. A lot of the time it's
      not overly difficult, so you do feel like you're
      being productive, but i guess that'd be the favorite
      part of my job. I mean i'm saying it's not that difficult,
      so i think the simplicity helps, you know, granted though
      like when it does get difficult, it gets really difficult.
      It's like a high risk high reward kind of situation. I
      hope that kind of answered your question. I don't know,
      it's kind of hard to pinpoint something like that, you
      know like everyday I love this, I can't wait to do that
      or something. It can get a bit mundane, but on the other
      hand you're not being stressed out every single hour of
      the day. Sometimes it could be a really relaxing week,
      I got all the stuff that I did, I had no bumps in the
      road. Other times it can just beat you down pretty
      often.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #15-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q15: Is there anything that you don't like
    about your job?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A:  It can get a bit repetitive, but I mean the hours
      are great. My shift is pretty cool and I don't feel
      tired most of the time. I guess like maybe seventy
      percent of the time I don't feel exhausted afterwards.
      I guess so like the whole simplicity is like a double
      edged sword, like sometimes it's really good, sometimes
      it's like really boring.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #16-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q16: um so my next question would be like do you
    often have to recall back on knowledge learned in
    university or did your job equip you with a lot of
    the knowledge that's necessary to be successful
    there</button>


  <div class="content">
    <p>A: um i guess if you just like terminology,
      common words are always metaphase or cell cycle
      stuff. Like chromosomes and all that stuff you're
      like expected to know the moment you walk in that
      door, or the moment you're hired. </p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #17-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q17: If somebody is listening to this interview,
    which would be an undergrad at UT, what would be
    the steps that they need to take to become a cytogenetic
    technologist after they graduate?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: You have to go to one of the board certified
      programs for cytogenetics. The biggest one is here
      at houston called MD Anderson. It’s a 12 month thing
      and after that you do your board certification test
      and then that’s pretty much it. </p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #18-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q18: Do you need to keep up with the
    certification?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: Once you get it, if you're working, you just
      continue earning education credits like at your job.
      So you just do those while you're hired, but if you're
      but if you're not working then you do have 18 months or
      two years until it does expire so you have to get
      recertified. If you're working though, you don't have to
      worry, you just keep doing those continued education
      credits and they're basically little lectures on topics
      related to the field.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #19-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q19: I was just wondering if you had any advice
    for like just students in general going through
    college or trying to find a job going right out
    of college?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: Like any advice on that ummm... I feel
      like it's a little the whole idea of like finding
      something that you love doing is a little misleading
      because I don't think you're ever going to find
      something that you won't find something wrong with.
      At some point you're going to find something you're
      not going to love doing everything. I feel like what
      helps me, I like doing something bio related or even
      healthcare related because it does feel important. I
      like the idea of having something that is important
      to society. So I would say that when you're trying
      to figure out what to do with your major, focus less
      on what the everyday function of the specific job is
      because you're gonna find fault with everything I
      think. </p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #20-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q20: What were the key takeaways from school that
    you were able to apply to your field of work?</button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: I would say the whole idea of working with others.
       Once you get into the workforce, it's going to be diverse
       like times 10. So I guess that was a big thing that I like
       drew upon experience to deal with certain stuff. Other
       than that, I guess maybe the ability to take in information
       quickly. I don't know if that was a takeaway or more like
       just something that you develop just by how much you
       study at UT. </p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #21-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q21: Do you think that for biology, we should
    just study the book or is it better if we get
    real life experience like an internship at
    a lab? </button>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A: I don't know if you absolutely need
      anything. I feel like if you feel the need
      to do something extra like an internship,
      go ahead and do it. I don't necessarily think
      you need to do something to get a better grasp
      of biology. I think it's more of a personal
      thing, yet if you're interested in a lab like
      yeah go try it out. See how the lab works you
      know or something in healthcare. Go volunteer
      for stuff like that, I don't think it's a specific
      thing that everyone needs to do, it's more of a
      just what do you like what piques your interest.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Question #22-->
  <button class="collapsible">
    Q22: How was your first couple weeks on the job?
    How intimidated were you and did you feel fully
    equipped to handle all the challenges thrown at
    you?</button>


  <div class="content">
    <p>A: Going in, I was definitely nervous, but for
      my specific job they really babied you into the
      whole first like month or two. They slowly build
      up your confidence so that later they kind of just
      let you go through the deep end and like let's see
      if you can swim. So it seemed like even though I
      felt more nervous at the beginning, I had less
      pressure. As opposed to now, where they expect you
      to be at a certain level of skill. If you messed up
      early like when you were first getting in, they
      would be like no big deal because you know they're
      not expecting much from you, but now like if you
      mess up like well that’s now an issue. </p>
