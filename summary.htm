  Summary
  </h1>

  <p1>
  Cytogenetics is a branch of genetics that studies the structure of
  chromosomes to diagnose and monitor acquired and inherited abnormalities.
  (1) The field of cytogenetics expands from prenatal to oncology analysis
  using various type of samples such as amniotic fluid, peripheral blood,
  and bone marrow. (1)
  </p1>

  <p1>
  The main responsibility of a cytogenetic technologist is to karyotype
  human chromosome preparations using different computer imaging systems to
  help doctors diagnose genetic disorders (inherited abnormalities) and
  different types of cancer (acquired abnormalities) (1). This is an example
  of a normal human karyotype that does not have any abnormalities in their
  chromosome

  Cytogenetic technologists can also be part of making these chromosome
  preparation in a wet lab. After collecting a sample, the main goal
  is to try to arrest cells during the metaphase stage of the cell cycle.
  This is because at this point the chromosomes are aligned in the metaphase
  plate  and will be the most visible under a microscope. One common chemical
  used for this is called colcomid which works by interfering with the spindle
  fiber that separates the chromosomes (3). Therefore, the cells will never
  advance into anaphase and will be stuck in the metaphase stage.
</p1>

  <p1>
  These preparations then go through different processes such as
  hypotonic treatment, G banding staining, and slide dropping so a
  cytogenetic technologist can analyze them and create a karyotype
  that shows the results of the analysis. If there is a change or
  abnormality in certain genes these might be visible in a karyotype.
  For example,  one common abnormality in the cancer type CML
  (Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia)  is a translocation between the
  chromosomes 9 and 22 (4). The technologists will then report the
  results to  physicians for a treatment plan.

  So for our interview, we got onto a zoom call with Fernando Garza
  who is a Cytogenetic Technologist at NEOGenomics. He told us what
  life looks like for him as a cytogenesis as well as how he used what
  he learned from school and biology to help him in his field of work
  at NEO. Fernando told us the challenges as well as the benefits to
  working in such a rigorous field and how people who are just starting
  out in biology can find out how we can get to where he is one day.
  </p1>

  <p1>
  NEOGenomics is a cancer diagnosis pharma service company that develops
  and delivers lab diagnostics and clinical trial services that focus on
  cancer. They are meant to try and either if the patient has cancer as
  well as try to create more effective drugs to combat against this disease.
  NEOGenomics looks at the bone marrow as well as surgical pathology in
  order to help provide fast and accurate information so the doctors can
  know what they are dealing with when it comes to the patient. (5)
  </p1>

  <p1>
  This job requires higher education and experience such as: a bachelorâ€™s
  degree in the field of Cytogenetics, a certification from the American
  Society of Clinical Pathologists, and lab experience. According to many
  resources, the median annual salary of this job is $61,000.
